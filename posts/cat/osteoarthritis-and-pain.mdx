## Osteoarthritis and pain

Cats are so stubborn – even if they have osteoarthritis! Unfortunately, they are also by nature real masters in hiding their pain or discomfort. Pain is a common problem in cats. But cats don’t clearly show that they are in pain, therefore it is often not (immediately) noticed by owners – no matter how well they know their cat. The good news is you can identify the pain, if you know what to look at.

## Condition

Osteoarthritis is an inflammatory disease that is getting worse over time. Osteoarthritis is also popularly referred to as arthrosis.

A cat with osteoarthritis has pain every day. This is due to the (damage caused by the) inflammation that are associated with osteoarthritis.

Arthrosis is the most common cause of chronic pain in cats. Did you know that about two in three cats over the age of 6 has arthritis?

*Fact: 2 in 3 cats have or suffer from osteoarthritis*

Osteoarthritis is not just about pain. Osteoarthritis is an inflammatory disease that causes deterioration of the hips, knees, spine and other joints. The inflammation of osteoarthritis damages the entire joint. It causes swelling of the joint, breakdown of cartilage and abnormal bone growth.

So a cat with osteoarthritis suffers pain each and every day, and a normal life for the cat is getting a little more difficult. And the longer your cat is in pain, the more sensitive his/her nervous system becomes to pain. When the disease is not treated, the cat will experience more pain and the joints will deteriorate further.

The pain that a cat has impedes the cat's daily life, over and over again. Fortunately, with proper treatment you can not only reduce the pain, but also inhibit the joint inflammation in your cat.

## Symptoms

Recognizing pain in a cat is not always easy! A cat always hides his weakness from others. It is often thought that the cat is *just* old. Old age obviously comes with flaws, but old age itself is not a disease. An older cat should also be able to run and jump well.

You might think, *My cat gets a little older.* Fill in the questionnaire to be sure and visit your veterinarian. With a simple check-up, it can quickly see if your cat is bothered by something, even if your cat is doing it's best to hide it.

You can recognize pain in a cat by <Link href='/'>body language</Link>, facial expression and behavior. The <Link href='/cat/deep-knowledge/understanding-sleeping-positions'>lying position</Link> also tells a lot about how a cat feels. We distinguish between two types of pain in cats: chronic (long-term) or acute pain.

### Signals of chronic pain

Pain which lasts longer than three months, is chronic pain. The signs of osteoarthritis in cats can be very subtle. For example, you notice that your cat is behaving a bit differently, or that his/her fur looks a bit sloppy lately.

The signals are not obvious, it is good to always be extra alert to one of the these signals that can indicate possible osteoarthritis in cats:

<ListSimple>

- Less good or more hesitant movements
- Changing state of mind or mood
- More sleep and stiff after waking up
- Difficulty with climbing stairs
- Less grooming or self-care, longer nails and fur
- Peeing or pooping in unusual places
- Decreased appetite

</ListSimple>

### Signals of acute pain

Acute pain is different from pain from arthritis. Acute pain in cats occurs after an incident, such as an accident or an operation. In the past, it was sometimes thought that cats can not feel (acute) pain, but that is nonsense. Think about it: would you like to wake up after an operation without adequate pain relief? If a cat is not to be handled anyway, this may be due to the pain.

### What is the lying position of a cat without pain?

A cat without pain often takes on the <Link href='/cat/deep-knowledge/understanding-sleeping-positions'>*croissant position*</Link>: the ears stand up and are directed to them. You can draw an imaginary horizontal line through the corners of the eye. The back is minimally raised and the cat seems attentive and alert. Because the cat has folded its front legs under it, this lying position is called the Croissant.

## Diagnosis

If you discover or suspect that your cat is in pain, make an appointment with the veterinarian!

Your veterinarian will physically examine your cat to find out where the pain comes from. Sometimes it is necessary to rule out other conditions or to make X-rays. So making the diagnosis does not have to be long and costly. Fortunately, osteoarthritis no longer has to be an obstacle for your cat.

## Treatment

Note: it is very important that you always seek advice from the vet, because he/she can substantiate what is best for your cat. If you accidentally give your cat the wrong remedy, it can be harmful.

Does your cat have osteoarthritis? That is shocking, but fortunately you can easily give your cat the best care with the veterinarian. A combination of analgesic anti-inflammatory drugs and, where necessary, change in diet and lifestyle, help your cat live a pleasant and comfortable life despite the osteoarthritis.

The vet will make a treatment plan with you that can actually be fit into the life of you and your cat. The best osteoarthritis care consists of 5 points:

<ListSimple>

- Pain-killing anti-inflammatory
- A healthy weight
- Body movement
- Comfortable at home
- Checks at the Veterinarian

</ListSimple>

Your cat has osteoarthritis for the rest of his/her life, so the anti-inflammatory drugs must also be given a lifetime. Fortunately, you quickly notice why you are doing it, because you see quick effect. For example, your cat jumps back on window sills or catching mice. Often, therefore, owners only notice that after the treatment that something was wrong.

The veterinarian may also prescribe dietary supplements or a diet. This is a support of the treatment, a healthier weight for your cat if necessary. However, it cannot do what an medication does, inhibit inflammation and at the same time relieve pain.

In addition to analgesic anti-inflammatory drugs especially for cats, you can take measures in the house to make the environment more pleasant. By unburdening your cat in some ways, you prevent him/her from having unnecessary pain and you can promote recovery.

We put some practical tips for you:

<ListSimple>

- Ensure a healthy body weight through appropriate cat food, offered in the right amount. Feel free to ask your vet for advice on which diet is suitable for your cat.
- Create soft berths, which your cat can easily reach.
- Make sure your cat doesn’t have to jump to sleep in a quiet place, for example.
- Reduce walking distances for your cat. For example, place multiple feed and water trays through the house.
- Use a low-entry litter box so that your cat can use the container without difficulty.

## Prevention

Osteoarthritis is common in cats, and unfortunately is unavoidable. Cats of all ages can suffer from it, but middle-age cats in particular suffer from it. Keep in mind that a 7-year-old cat is already a senior.

Most cats are unknown to the cause of osteoarthritis. The following factors have been shown to increase the risk of osteoarthritis in cats:

<ListSimple>

- <span>Cat breed: in some cats we see more arthrosis, for example because of their physique. Consider, for example, hip dysplasia with the <Link href=''>Maine Coon</Link> and <Link href=''>Siamese</Link> or the disrupted kneecaps with an <Link href=''>Abyssinian</Link> or <Link href=''>Devon Rex</Link>. But ordinary domestic cats might as well get osteoarthritis.</span>
- Cat size: Large breeds and overweight cats are at greater risk of osteoarthritis due to the extra strain on their joints.
- Joint injury: an injury like a bone fracture can cause abnormal tension in a joint. This can still cause problems after the injury is cured.
- Lifestyle: cats that have access to the outside air have a slightly greater risk of accidents, or often burden their joints more often when running and jumping more often. On the other hand, running outside is also healthy behavior for a cat, and indoor cats can just as well get osteoarthritis. You do not have to keep your cat inside for fear of osteoarthritis, which guarantees nothing.

</ListSimple>

Whatever the cause of osteoarthritis, it is especially important to keep this inflammatory disease under control as well as possible. Do not let your cat suffer unnecessarily in silence and give him/her a regular health check with your veterinarian.

When a standard treatment does not help enough, there are even special pain specialists for animals who may be able to help you even further. If necessary, your veterinarian can refer you to these specialists.
