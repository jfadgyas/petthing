## Diabetes mellitus

Diabetes mellitus, in short diabetes, is a disease in which the amount of sugar in the blood is too high. Every cat can get diabetes; about 1 in 100 cats suffer from it. The most common form of diabetes in cats is similar to diabetes type 2 in humans.

If you have been told that your cat has diabetes, it is often quite shocking. Fortunately, this disease can be treated well so that your cat can also lead a normal life with diabetes.

## Condition

About 1 in 100 cats will develop diabetes. Most cats are over 6 years old at the time of diagnosis, but can also occur in younger cats. Being overweight (obesity) is an important risk factor in cats, but genes or other diseases can also play a role. In principle, any cat can develop diabetes, not just old or fat cats.

Sugar (glucose) is normally a source of energy for body cells. If your cat has diabetes, the body cells are no longer able to absorb glucose from the blood. Normally, the hormone insulin helps to remove glucose from the bloodstream. But with diabetes, the body no longer responds properly to insulin. As a result, the amount of glucose in the blood increases and glucose is not (properly) processed for the production of energy. Having no energy means that you feel listless and bad.

Diabetes has a certain course. The body initially no longer responds properly to the hormone insulin produced by the pancreas for a long time. The pancreas will have to work harder to produce more insulin. If this takes too long, the pancreas will eventually produce less or no insulin at all, which will be exhausted. A shortage of insulin will occur.

The cat's glucose must remain within certain values ​​(normal values). If a cat's blood glucose level is elevated for a long time, this is harmful to parts of the body, such as the eyes, nerves and the pancreas. If the blood glucose level becomes too low, this is called <Link href='#hypoglycemia'>hypoglycemia</Link> (read more below). Both are complications that can be life-threatening for your cat.

## Symptoms

If diabetes in a cat is not treated properly, the cat will become increasingly ill and serious complications may arise. It is therefore important to recognise the symptoms as soon as possible. You can recognise diabetes in a cat by:

<ListSimple>

- Drinking more
- Urinating more
- Eating more
- Weight loss, even though the cat is eating well
- Lethargy
- Weakness

</ListSimple>

Do you recognise one or more of these symptoms in your cat? Always contact your vet immediately! The symptoms of diabetes can also occur with other conditions. A vet will therefore always have to perform a number of additional tests, such as blood and urine tests, before the diagnosis can be made.

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis of feline diabetes is made through a combination of physical examination, blood tests and urinalysis.

<ListSimple>

- <span>**Physical examination:** Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical examination to assess your cat’s overall health and to rule out other possible causes of the symptoms.</span>
- <span>**Blood tests:** Your veterinarian will use a blood test to measure the glucose level in the blood. Your veterinarian may also measure fructosamine levels, which is an indicator of the average blood glucose level over the past few weeks. Ketones may also be measured in the blood – see urinalysis below.</span>
- <span>**Urinalysis:** Your veterinarian will use a urinalysis to check for glucose and/or ketones in the urine. Ketones can indicate a serious condition that requires immediate treatment.</span>
- <span>**Additional tests:** In some cases, your veterinarian may perform additional tests to rule out other conditions. These may include a test for pancreatitis or an abdominal ultrasound. Your veterinarian will be able to explain what they think is necessary and why based on their preliminary findings.</span>

## Treatment

After diagnosing diabetes, the vet will draw up a treatment plan that will include administering medication. The vet will often prescribe a modified diet. It is also always important that the cat achieves or maintains a healthy body weight. Getting your cat to exercise more is also an important part of the treatment.

A cat with diabetes has an insulin deficiency. There are 2 ways to treat this. You can give medication that allows the cat to produce insulin itself again. Or you can directly administer the hormone insulin via injection.

- ### Treatment with an SGLT2 inhibitor

It has recently become possible to treat cats with diabetes mellitus type 2 with a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. With an SGLT2 inhibitor, cats achieve stable blood sugar levels within 1 week. We do not see dangerously low blood sugar levels with this medication. (Read about hypoglycemia below). It is administered directly into the mouth once a day or mixed with a small amount of food and eaten. This can reduce or even completely eliminate the symptoms of diabetes. This medication has a fixed dosage based on the weight of the cat.

An SGLT2 inhibitor is only suitable for cats that still have sufficient cells that can produce insulin. This will be the case for most cats with diabetes. Veterinarians can assess whether cats are a good candidate for an SGLT2 inhibitor.

If the cat can no longer produce insulin itself, the cat will always have to be given insulin as a medicine. After all, the body cannot function without insulin. If a cat can no longer produce insulin itself, the body will produce ketones. These can be harmful in large quantities. That is why cats that are given an SGLT2 inhibitor must be monitored extra carefully for the development of ketones, especially at the start of treatment. Ketones are formed by the body if a cat cannot produce insulin itself. Measuring ketones can be done easily with a special strip in the urine (e.g. in wet cat litter) or a test in the blood.

The team at the veterinary practice can help with practical advice and tips. With the right care, it is possible for a cat with diabetes lead a pleasant life.

- ### Treatment with insulin

If the cat can no longer produce insulin itself, insulin is always necessary as medication. Without insulin, body cells cannot process sugar for the production and storage of energy.

With insulin treatment, you inject the insulin directly under your cat's skin. This must almost always be done twice a day, preferably at fixed times. Every cat with diabetes needs a different dosage of insulin. If you give too much insulin to a cat, it can develop dangerously low blood sugar levels (<Link href='#hypoglycemia'>hypoglycemia</Link>; see below). That is why the dosage is started low and slowly increased until it has the best effect.

*Setting up the cat* i.e. regulating blood sugar levels with the correct dosage of insulin can take a month or more. However, once blood sugar levels are stable, cats will feel better. Symptoms of diabetes may decrease and sometimes even disappear altogether. Your cat’s insulin needs (and therefore the required dosage) may change during treatment. So, close monitoring is essential. This is done by regularly checking blood sugar levels and keeping a close eye on your cat’s behaviour and symptoms.

A veterinarian can help you get the treatment and monitoring right. A regular routine is also important to keep your blood sugar levels in balance. Maintaining a regular daily pattern, especially with regard to medication and food, helps with this. Regular check-ups at the vet, even after symptoms have disappeared, are essential. With a periodic check-up, the vet can determine whether a cat is responding well to the treatment. And whether, for example, less, more or different medication is needed.

### What to do in case of <strong id='hypoglycemia'>hypoglycemia</strong> in cats?

Hypoglycemia is when the blood sugar level is too low. A hypoglycemia is a dangerous and potentially fatal complication that can occur if a cat has received too much insulin, too little food or much more exercise than normal during insulin treatment.

Do you give insulin to your cat with diabetes? Make sure you always have honey or sugar syrup around, and contact your vet immediately if you notice any of the following signs:

<ListSimple>

- Abnormal hunger or lack of eating
- Vomiting
- Abnormal fatigue/weakness
- Trembling, staggering, muscle twitching
- Collapse, seizures, coma

</ListSimple>

Hypoglycemia is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention. Follow these steps if you think your cat may be hypoglycemic:

### Is your cat (almost) unconscious?

Rub a tablespoon of glucose syrup or honey on the gums and call your vet immediately, regardless of the day or time! If your cat does not regain consciousness or has an epileptic seizure, take your cat to a vet immediately.

### Is your cat conscious and can he swallow?

Feed your cat sugar syrup or honey by hand until he is alert enough to eat normally. Then give the meal that was planned (so do not wait for the 'normal meal time') and call your vet for advice.

### <span id='dka'>Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)</span>

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication of diabetes and can occur in cats regardless of which medication they are given: insulin or an SGLT2 inhibitor. An untreated cat with diabetes can also get DKA. It indicates a major insulin deficiency, which can only be solved by giving (more) insulin. If the cat does not produce any or insufficient insulin, the cat will always have to be given insulin as medication. After all, the body cannot function without insulin.

In DKA, too many ketones (a type of waste product) are formed in the body. This disrupts all kinds of important processes. Which can be life-threatening. If a cat has DKA, immediate advice and additional treatment by the vet is necessary. Due to the health risk caused by DKA, it is important to always pay close attention to the following signals in a cat with diabetes:

<ListSimple>

- Lethargy
- Dehydration
- Unwanted weight loss
- Vomiting
- Little or no eating
- Little or no drinking

</ListSimple>

Always contact your vet immediately if you notice any of the signals and indicate that you suspect DKA.

As mentioned, DKA occurs in cats regardless of which medication they are given: insulin or an SGLT2 inhibitor. An increase in ketones is always a possible signal. Cats that are given insulin as medication almost always have high blood sugar levels with DKA. However, cats that are treated with an SGLT2 inhibitor almost always have normal blood glucose levels. Therefore, cats for DKA risk are monitored mainly based on the signs the cat shows and the development of ketones in blood or urine. The veterinary team will explain how and how often an owner should test for this.

### Lifestyle and Diet Food

What your cat eats is very important. But a healthy body weight can also make a big difference in keeping blood sugar levels in check. Therefore, follow your veterinarian's recommendations for the right diet or body weight for your cat. Playing with your cat and keeping your cat active is also an important part of treating diabetes.

## Prevention

There is not always a specific cause for the development of diabetes. It is a complex condition in which many factors play a role. It is therefore not always possible to determine why your cat has developed diabetes. Any cat can develop diabetes, but being overweight (obesity) and physically inactive can increase the risk. That is why it is important to prevent overweight and inactivity in cats. The team at a veterinary practice can advise on this.

A cat often only shows that he/she is not well when a condition gets worse. It is therefore common for owners to realize that their animal is ill too late. Older cats in particular are at greater risk of various common conditions. Did you know that a cat is already a somewhat older cat from the age of 7?

That is why it is important to have an older cat checked more often. Regular checks by the vet can ensure that common conditions in cats are detected earlier. For older cats (from the age of seven), this means at least one check-up per year. For cats older than eleven years, it is advisable to visit the vet at least twice a year.

With regular check-ups, the vet gets to know your cat well, is aware of its medical history and can intervene before problems arise. Starting the right treatment in time can prevent greater damage and pain for your cat. That is why regular check-ups at the vet are very important, especially for older cats.
